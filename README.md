Find All Duplicates
Write a function (in python) or method (in Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once.

different approaches - nested loops through each and check every spot to each spot, good but it takes a lot of time which can be bad
or use a map/dictionary. could do 2 different ones and have a duplicates and a seen one. much less time complexity
